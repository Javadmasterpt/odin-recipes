        <p>
            The smartest way to make ratatouille quickly is on a sheet pan. The summer squash, eggplants, and bell peppers roast in the oven and are then combined with fresh tomatoes and herbs. The heat of the oven-roasted vegetables draws out moisture from the tomatoes, creating a light, slightly brothy, and incredibly delicious sauce.

            This sheet pan ratatouille is perfect for summer, when you don't want to stand in front of a hot pot of classic ratatouille. It's a mostly hands-off recipe—the vegetables roast for about 45 minutes—perfect for a weeknight supper. It’s easy enough for a casual family gathering and impressive enough for dinner guests.

                1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper or crushed red pepper flakes

                2 cups grape or cherry tomatoes, halved
            </li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, parsley, or chives
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
            </li>
            <li>
                Extra-virgin olive oil, for serving
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>

                Preheat the oven to 425°F. 
                Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line two rimmed sheet pans with silicone baking mats or foil. Generously spray each with cooking spray and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season the vegetables:
                In a large bowl, add the eggplant, summer squash, bell pepper, onion, garlic, and Aleppo pepper. Toss to combine.
                Equally divide the vegetables between the two prepared sheet pans. Generously spritz them with nonstick cooking spray. Season with the black pepper, but not the salt! Salt will draw out moisture, making the vegetables too wet as they cook.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the vegetables:
                Roast the vegetables, rotating the sheet pans and stirring the vegetables once, until they are lightly browned and softened, about 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tomatoes and basil: 
                As soon as you take the vegetables out of the oven, add the tomatoes and basil. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve:
                Taste and adjust for seasoning with salt and black pepper. Want a more luxurious texture? Drizzle in some olive oil to taste or serve it on the side for drizzling on top. Serve hot, at room temperature, or chilled. Bon appétit, y’all!
                Refrigerate leftovers for up to 3 days in a covered container. Granted the vegetables will become softer, but they will also become more flavorful. So, yes! Bonus points if you have leftovers! Serve it in wrap, on a salad, or smear it on a sandwich. It’s also super as a chunky spread on crackers or crostini.
